# My personal .dotfiles

Every developer should have this, a personal .dotfiles repository. A collection of configuration files and scripts that one uses to set up their development environment on a new machine.

Mine is mostly focused on setting up a new macOS machine with all the tools I need for my daily work. I used to have a private one in the past but it was a mess. I decided to start from scratch and build a new one.

My current setup includes:

- **Homebrew**: Package manager for macOS
- **GH Cli**: GitHub CLI
- **Kitty**: GPU-based terminal emulator
- **Midnight Commander**: File manager for the terminal
- **Helix**: A post-modern text editor for the terminal
- **FNM**: Fast Node Manager
- **Python & Pipx**: Python and package installer
- **Tmux**: Terminal multiplexer
- **TPM**: Tmux Plugin Manager
- **Fish Shell**: Command line shell
- **OMF**: Oh My Fish
- **Fisher**: Plugin manager for Fish
- **Starship**: Cross-shell prompt

It needs some more work but it's a good start. I'll keep adding more tools and configurations as I go.
