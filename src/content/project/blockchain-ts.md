# Blockchain.ts

This is a project I started a while ago to learn more about blockchain technology. It started out as a simple JavaScript project to create a blockchain and networking between nodes. I've decided to rewrite the project in TypeScript and make it a bit more advanced.

The goal of this project is to create a simple blockchain network application in TypeScript. The application will consist of a blockchain network with multiple nodes that can communicate with each other to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. The application will also have a simple proof-of-work and proof-of-stake algorithm to secure the network.

Please note that this is a learning project and not intended for production use. I'm building this to learn more about blockchain technology and how it works.

## Progress

I'll update this page with more information as I make progress on the project.
