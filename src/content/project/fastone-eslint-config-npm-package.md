# @fastone/eslint-config npm package

> I've published this package a while ago and have been using it on some projects, but failed to keep it up to date. I'm planning to update it soon.

As I'm finally getting more and more into TypeScript and working out a development stack based on MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js I decided to publish an ESLint config package, to be used in all my projects.
So that I don't have to keep copy/pasting the same config over and over again for each project. A bit of a 'one to rule them all' kind of thing.

It's a very simple config, based on the Airbnb TypeScript Style Guide, and probably during the usage of it I'll add more rules to it.

Feel free to check it out and use it in your own projects, or even contribute to it.
