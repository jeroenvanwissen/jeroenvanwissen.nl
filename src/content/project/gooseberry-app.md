> Twitch chat bot, overlays and more for my live streams.

Finally implemented the category pages to have an overview of posts in a specific category. \o/
It's still in an really early prototyping phase, but I've started yet another new personal coding project :)

The main goal of this project is to create a simple, easy to use, cross-platform desktop application that allows me to manage things like Twitch chat commands, channel points rewards, task lists, pomodoro timers, etc. while streaming on Twitch.

I've been streaming on Twitch every now and then and I've been using a lot of different tools to manage all these things. But I've never been able to find a tool that does everything I want. So I decided to build my own. And have everything in one place.

It will be fully open source, so anyone can use it and contribute to it.
