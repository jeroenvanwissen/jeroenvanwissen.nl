# Stream Farm

> I've been working on this game for a while now, it has been refactored multiple times. It's a fun little project I started to build on my live streams on Twitch. It's a simple idle game where you can sow, water and harvest crops to produce resources. You can buy seeds and sell harvested crops to make money.

The backend is core of the game build with NestJS and a PostgreSQL database to store the game state. The frontend is built with Phaser 3. The backend uses Server Side Events to communicate updates to the Frontend. The game can run headless, the Frontend is not required to run and play the game.

I started this project to learn more about game development and to have a fun project to work on during my live streams. I've learned a lot about game development, TypeScript, NestJS, Phaser 3 and PostgreSQL while working on this project.

But, as with all my projects, it's still a work in progress. And I will update this page with more information as I make progress on the project.
