I could have called this 'Dutch Summer of 2023', as it reflects an average summer day in the Netherlands. Wanted to go out for a hike to shoot some pictures to try out a new lens, but the weather was not really on the same page. Lucky it only started to rain once I got back after to my car, but it was quite windy..
