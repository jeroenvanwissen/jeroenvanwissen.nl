**_This needs to be rewritten and updated_**

This is something I've been incrementally struggling with the last couple of years.

Finding it really hard to keep up with the development going on in JavaScript world, new frameworks, new ways of doing things etc etc. And mostly when going on social media ( twitter ) trying to get some sources to keep up to date, a feeling of multiple sides. Where it gets really hard to get the validation of which way is the correct way to go.
