  Why does everything need to have a purpose. Often when I read about some
  interesting tech thing on the internet I start thinking about where could I
  use it for, what could I build with it..

And that's also where it ends most of the times. As my creativity mostly ends on the technology level and I'm not that good in creating actual product ideas that could be used by end-users. I recently had a chat with a friend about just building and creating things just for the process and journey. Not so much for having an actual useful product at the end. This process gives so much more freedom to just experiment with things, without the pressure of needing to have a vision on a product. And meanwhile learn some new technology...

It's about time for me to give my brains a little kick and start coding without a purpose...
