# Hype or Revolution: Keeping Up with JavaScript

> I've been working with JavaScript for over two decades now, close to since it was invented. I wouldn't see myself as an expert in the core language, but I've worked with it long enough to see the evolution of the language and the ecosystem around it.

There is a lot of love and hate for JavaScript, I also feel some hate every now and then. And there's nothing wrong with that imho.

JavaScript has been around for a long time, and it has evolved a lot over the years. It started as a simple scripting language for the web, and now it's a full-blown programming language that can be used for almost anything.

The language moves fast. New frameworks, libraries and build tools pop up almost daily. Each one of them promising to be the next big thing we should all be using. If we would do that, we would be rewriting our projects every other week.... I feel like I'm already doing that anyway.

But that's also the beauty of JavaScript. It's a language that is constantly evolving, and that's what makes it so exciting to work with. You never know what new features will be added next, or what new tools will be released that will make your life as a developer easier.

## Hype cycle

A common pattern in the ecosystem follows something similar to Gartner's Hype Cycle:

1. **Technology Trigger**: A new tool appears, often solving a common pain point in a fresh way.
2. **Peak of Inflated Expectations**: The community gets excited, tutorials flood in, and everyone seems to be using it.
3. **Trough of Disillusionment**: Real-world use exposes limitations. Early adopters move on, and the initial excitement dies down.
4. **Slope of Enlightenment**: The tool stabilizes, documentation improves, and it finds its niche.
5. **Plateau of Productivity**: It becomes a standard or carves out a lasting role in the ecosystem.

This cycle can be seen in many tools and libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. Some tools never make it past the Peak of Inflated Expectations, while others become staples in the community.

When evaluating a new framework, library or tool. Consider this:

- **Who is backing it?** A tool backed by a large company is more likely to be around for a while. (React by Meta, TypeScript by Microsoft, etc..) But also, a tool backed by a large company can be dropped at any time. Google !?
- **What problem does it solve?** Does it solve a problem you have? Or does it solve a problem you might have in the future?
- **How active is the community?** A large, active community is a good sign that the tool will be around for a while. But also, a large, active community can be toxic and not open to new ideas.
- **How well is it documented?** Good documentation is key to the success of a tool. If you can't figure out how to use it, you're not going to use it. (Unless you really like it and want to contribute to the documentation)
- **What's the adoption rate?** Check out the GitHub stars, npm downloads, etc.. to see how popular the tool is. But also, popularity doesn't always mean quality.

## Keeping up

So how do you keep up with all the new tools and libraries that are constantly being released in the JavaScript ecosystem?

2. **Follow the community**: Follow the developers of the tools you use on Twitter/X, Bluesky, GitHub, etc.. They often post updates and news about their tools.
3. **Contribute**: If you find a bug, fix it. If you have an idea, implement it. Contributing to open-source projects is a great way to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest tools and libraries.
4. **Experiment**: Try out new tools and libraries in your personal projects. Don't be afraid to break things. That's how you learn.
5. **Be selective**: You can't use every new tool that comes out. Be selective, and only use the tools that solve a real problem for you.

## Conclusion

Not every new framework is the next React, and not every experimental tool is a waste of time. Often by just trying out new tools and libraries you'll learn something new, even if you don't end up using it in your projects. Don't blindly follow the hype, but also don't dismiss it. Keep an open mind, and always be willing to learn new things.

Be selective, you can't have it all.
