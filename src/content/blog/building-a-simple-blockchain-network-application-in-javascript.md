  As part of my 'Coding without a purpose...' brainfart, I finally started a
  project that has been on my mind for ages. Building a simple blockchain
  network application in Javascript.

You'll probably think, this guy is crazy.. yeap I probably am. No way that this is going to be an useful application. Or anything near to a real operating blockchain with any value. Just taking on the challenge and triggering my brains a bit, maybe I'll finally learn a bit more about the underlaying technology of blockchains. Or it will be just a complete waste of time, at least I hope I had fun.

Of course I will put the progress, once I have any, on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeroenvanwissen/blockchain-js "GitHub")
