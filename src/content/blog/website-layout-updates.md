    Decided to redo the website a bit, wasn't too happy with the previous black/white theme. Also simplified things a bit and started working with the Astro.build Content Collection feature.

I'm no designer, my design skills aren't that good... but I managed to get this together. So far I'm happy with how things look now, I know on mobile it doesn't look perfect yet.

Soon I'll add a recipes section, food and beer. I'm going to open-soure my home brewery recipes and going to share some food recipes I like to make and eat.
