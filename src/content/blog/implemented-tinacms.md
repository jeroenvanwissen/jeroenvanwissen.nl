  Was looking for a really simple CMS system that would just publish Markdown
  (.md) files to GitHub and found that TinaCMS could do the job...
---

Implemented it to this website and going to give it a try to see if I'm going to keep it.

Adding it to an existing [Astro.build](https://astro.build "Link to Astro.build website") website was quite easy. I only had some troubles with getting it to build and deploy correctly in Netlify, but that was mainly because I was editing the build commands in the wrong location.

Basic information on how to implement it on your [Astro.build](https://astro.build "Link to Astro.build website") website can be found on the [Astro.build docs page about TinaCMS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/tina-cms/ "Link to Astro.build docs website guide to implement TinaCMS")
