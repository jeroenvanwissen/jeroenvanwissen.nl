  Was looking for a really simple CMS system that would just publish .md files
  to GitHub and I found TinaCMS.

Implemented it to this website and going to give it a try to see if I'm going to keep it.

Adding it to an existing Astro.build website was quite easy. I only had some troubles with getting it to build and deploy correctly in Netlify, but that was mainly because I was editing the build commands in the wrong location.
