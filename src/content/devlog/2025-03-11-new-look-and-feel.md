I've updated the look and feel of the website. I've been working on a new design for a while now and finally got around to implementing it. I'm quite happy with the result, but I'm sure I'll be tweaking it a bit more in the coming weeks. There is a big change of things to be completely broken now, as I just wanted to get it out there. So if you find something that doesn't work, please let me know.
