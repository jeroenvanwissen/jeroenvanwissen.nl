## Instructions

### 1. Brown the chicken

1. Pat the chicken legs dry and season generously with salt and pepper.
2. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
3. Brown the chicken on all sides until golden (about 8-10 minutes total).
4. Remove from the pot and set aside.

### 2. Make the soffritto

1. In the same pot, add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic.
2. Cook gently over medium-low heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Add parsley and sage.
4. Cook until vegetables are soft, fragrant, and slightly sweet.

### 3. Build the sauce

1. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
2. Add the red wine and simmer for 3-5 minutes to cook off the alcohol.
3. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a gentle simmer.

### 4. Slow simmer

1. Return the chicken legs to the pot.
2. Cover and simmer on low heat for about 1½ hours, until the chicken is very tender.

### 5. Shred & finish

1. Remove the chicken from the pot.
2. Let it cool slightly, then shred the meat from the bones (discard skin and bones).
3. Meanwhile, simmer the sauce uncovered for about 15 minutes to thicken.
4. Return the shredded chicken to the sauce.
5. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

The ragù should be rich, slightly thick, and deeply savory.

### 6. Serve

1. Cook the pappardelle in boiling water until al dente.
2. Serve the pappardelle on a plate, adding the ragù on top.
3. Finish with freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.
